## Feel Good AI: Voice-Enabled Emotion-based Music Recommendation System

Feel Good AI is a novel effort committed to improving psychological well-being by means of methodically providing customized music suggestions that are in accordance with the user’s emotional state. By combining sophisticated recommendation algorithms with advanced technologies, most notably Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for facial emotion recognition, this project effortlessly develops innovative tech and empathetic emotional support. The users interact with an intuitive chatbot that generates unique music suggestions through the use of personalized conversations in which they are asked specific emotion-related inquiries. Beyond immediate relevance, incorporating AI-powered music curation to enhance positive emotional experiences for individuals, particularly those afflicted with dementia, is of greater significance. We live in a society where stress and mental health problems are prevalent. By combining problem-solving and emotional well-being, Feel Good AI offers evidence that technology can enhance the quality of life.
