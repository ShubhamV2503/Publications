## Autoencoder-Based Dual Noise Suppression for Brain CT Imaging: SNR Optimization Toward Accurate Clinical Diagnostics

In the realm of healthcare, systems including brain CT scans are affected by inevitable degradation that occurs in two forms, Poisson noise and periodic noise, which could interfere with diagnostic interpretation. In this work, we propose a deep learning denoising architecture that suppresses both types of noise through utilizing a convolutional autoencoder model while retaining important diagnostic information. The method we propose is completely compliant with DICOM files, so it can easily fit into the clinical workflow. We assessed the model performance on image quality by using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as our primary measure of importance and are able to show a major improvement after denoising. To add clinical relevancy, we also assessed whether our denoised images improved accuracy in downstream disease classification tasks to show improvement in accuracies. This work provides a scalable, efficient, and near real-time solution for interpreting CT scans and represents a major step forward toward artificial intelligence-enhanced diagnostic systems.
